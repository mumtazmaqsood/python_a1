we can create a class without __init__() method but if this method has been created then it called first and what are
the variables inside, must be given , otherwise there will be error, in init() method ,
object or instance variable can be created, as it written above that some attributes has te same values →
called class variables but some attributes values are not same → obj or instance variables,
like in above samsungGlasxay7 example, may be all attribute is the fixed values but phone has different color,
 in that case if we treat this color attribute as class then all the cell has the same color,
 in order to resolve this issue, we create a init() method and pass color variable so everytime when obj created
 then this color pass to the class and it will associate to specific obj and whenever we call that obj
  then its color will the same as what has given while creating its obj
self → keyword is getting obj reference mean
